# Error Monitoring

Monitor errors from Sentry for: $ARGUMENTS (or last hour if not specified)

**Using Sentry MCP integration to:**

1. **Fetch recent errors:**
   - Query Sentry API via MCP
   - Filter by timeframe
   - Group by issue

2. **Analyze errors:**
   - Count by severity
   - Identify new vs recurring
   - Find error spikes
   - Top affected users

3. **Prioritize:**
   - Critical: User-impacting, high frequency
   - High: Broken functionality
   - Medium: Degraded experience
   - Low: Edge cases

4. **Present findings:**
   ```
