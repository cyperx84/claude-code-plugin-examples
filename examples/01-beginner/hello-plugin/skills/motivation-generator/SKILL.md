# Motivation Generator

## Purpose

Generate motivational content specifically tailored for developers to:
- Overcome coding challenges
- Maintain focus and productivity
- Build confidence in their abilities
- Find inspiration during difficult tasks
- Celebrate progress and achievements

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User explicitly asks for motivation (/motivate command)
- User appears frustrated or stuck
- After completing a difficult task (celebration)
- During long coding sessions
- When learning something new and challenging

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Context

Determine the user's situation:
1. **Current Mood**: Frustrated, Stuck, Tired, Overwhelmed, Curious, Celebrating
2. **Task Difficulty**: Debugging, Learning new tech, Refactoring, Building from scratch
3. **Progress Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
4. **Time in Session**: Starting, Mid-session, Long session (>2 hours)

### Step 2: Choose Motivation Type

Select the appropriate motivation approach:

**Problem-Solving Motivation** (when stuck):
- Remind them that debugging is normal
- Share strategies for approaching problems
- Encourage breaking down the problem

**Learning Motivation** (when learning):
- Emphasize growth mindset
- Remind that every expert was once a beginner
- Celebrate small wins in understanding

**Persistence Motivation** (when tired):
- Acknowledge the effort
- Suggest taking breaks
- Remind of past successes

**Achievement Motivation** (when succeeding):
- Celebrate the win
- Reinforce good practices
- Encourage sharing knowledge

### Step 3: Craft the Message

Create a message with these elements:
1. **Acknowledgment**: Recognize their situation
2. **Inspiration**: Quote, principle, or wisdom
3. **Actionable Advice**: Concrete next step
4. **Encouragement**: Positive affirmation

### Step 4: Add Depth

Include one of:
- Relevant developer quote
- Productivity technique (Pomodoro, timeboxing)
- Mindset reframe
- Success story or example
- Technical tip related to their struggle

### For Debugging/Stuck

```
Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer.

Every developer faces bugs - it's not about avoiding them, but about developing
your debugging skills. Try:
1. Rubber duck debugging (explain it out loud)
2. Take a 5-minute break - fresh eyes catch bugs faster
3. Console.log/print your assumptions - one is probably wrong

You've got this! Every bug fixed makes you a stronger developer.
```

### For Learning Something New

```
"The expert in anything was once a beginner." - Helen Hayes

Learning a new framework/language feels overwhelming, but remember:
- You don't need to know everything, just enough to start
- Tutorials and docs are meant to be referenced, not memorized
- Every line of code you write is practice

Tip: Build something small with it today - learning by doing beats reading docs.

You're already braver than most by diving into something new!
```

### For Long Session/Fatigue

```
You've been coding hard! Remember: your brain isn't a machine.

The Pomodoro Technique suggests:
- 25 minutes focused work
- 5 minute break
- Every 4 sessions, take 15-30 minutes

Fresh code comes from a fresh mind. Some of the best solutions come
during breaks or even sleep!

Consider: stretch, hydrate, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

Your future self will thank you for the break!
```

### For Wins/Achievements

```
Look at you go! That's some solid problem-solving right there.

"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." - John Johnson

What you just accomplished shows:
- Strong analytical thinking
- Persistence
- Growth in your skills

Take a moment to appreciate your progress - you're building something real!

Ready to tackle the next challenge?
```

## Motivational Quotes Library

### Persistence
- "It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature." - Anonymous
- "The best error message is the one that never shows up." - Thomas Fuchs
- "Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code." - Dan Salomon

### Learning
- "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie
- "Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place." - Brian Kernighan
- "Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes." - Oscar Wilde

### Problem-Solving
- "If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." - Edsger Dijkstra
- "Code never lies, comments sometimes do." - Ron Jeffries
- "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements." - Brian Kernighan

### Success
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." - Kent Beck
- "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler
- "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency." - Austin Freeman

## Productivity Tips

### Focus Techniques
1. **Pomodoro**: 25 min work, 5 min break
2. **Timeboxing**: Allocate fixed time to tasks
3. **Two-minute rule**: If it takes <2 min, do it now
4. **Eat the frog**: Hardest task first

### Break Strategies
1. **20-20-20 rule**: Every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds
2. **Micro-breaks**: 30 seconds every 30 minutes
3. **Movement**: Stand, stretch, walk
4. **Hydration**: Water improves focus

### Debugging Strategies
1. **Rubber duck debugging**: Explain code to an object
2. **Binary search**: Comment out half, find which half breaks
3. **Git bisect**: Find the commit that introduced the bug
4. **Sleep on it**: Fresh perspective in the morning

## Output Format

```
[Empathetic acknowledgment or celebration]

[Inspirational quote or principle]

[Actionable advice or technique]

[Positive encouragement or next step]

[Optional: Relevant tip or fun fact]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Genuine**: Avoid hollow platitudes
2. **Be Specific**: Relate to their actual situation
3. **Be Actionable**: Give concrete next steps
